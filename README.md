The Game of Set
==============


**This is the classic game of Set, invented by Marsha Falco in 1974.**

It was inspired by her work in genetics, which she decided could be more fun.
There are 81 cards in the deck. The idea is to create a set
which consists of 3 cards, where their properties are either
all the same, or all different.

12 cards are dealt, which is the board. A player would then attempt to make a set
from the 12 available cards. This would be done by yelling **Set!**. After that set
and any others are discovered, 3 more cards are dealt from the deck to the board. This
continues until play is finished. A maximum of 27 sets can be made in the perfect game.
